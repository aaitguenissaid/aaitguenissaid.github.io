Hi, I’m **Abderrahmane Ait Gueni Ssaid**, an ML research engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). I’m passionate about advancing AI through both research and practical applications and am currently seeking opportunities in AI, Machine Learning, or Deep Learning, including PhD and engineering positions.

My journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and I have since completed four impactful internships that have shaped my expertise across AI and data science domains:

- At **Orange**, I worked on **evaluating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs)**, a project that culminated in a paper now under review. This experience taught me the intricacies of model adaptability and interpretability.

- At the **Grenoble Informatics Laboratory (LIG)**, I focused on **integrating information retrieval constraints into neural networks**, enhancing model efficiency.

- In another project at **LIG**, I applied **GAN-based data augmentation for semi-supervised learning**, refining my skills in robust model development.

- At the **Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences (GIN)**, I developed **imaging biomarkers for epilepsy** using clustering techniques, where I gained experience handling complex, multi-modal medical data.

I am proficient in Python, C/C++, Java, and various machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, making me well-equipped to tackle diverse challenges in AI and data science.

Outside of work, I stay current with tech trends, and in my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and spending time with family and friends. I am excited to bring my skills and dedication to a role that pushes the boundaries of AI and contributes to meaningful advancements.
