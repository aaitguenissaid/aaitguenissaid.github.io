Hi, I am Abderrahmane Ait gueni ssaid, a passionate computer science student. Currently pursuing my second year of a Master's degree in Computer Science specialized in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Grenoble INP-Ensimag, I am dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of AI and its applications.

My journey in the field of computer science began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I have since gained valuable experience in various domains, including machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, and software engineering. During my academic journey, I've had the privilege of working on cutting-edge research projects, such as integrating information retrieval constraints into deep neural networks and developing imaging biomarkers for epilepsy using machine learning.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am proficient in a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including C/C++, Java, Python, and more. I am also well-versed in popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

When I'm not coding or conducting research, you can find me exploring the latest developments in the tech world, experimenting with new programming languages.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and spending time with my family and friends.

I'm looking for a challenging and rewarding position in the field of data science or artificial intelligence. I'm confident that I have the skills and experience to be successful in this field.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
