Hi, I’m **Abderrahmane Ait Gueni Ssaid**, an ML research engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). I’m passionate about advancing AI through both practical and theoretical research and am currently seeking a PhD position in AI, ML or Deep Learning.

My journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and I have since completed four impactful internships that have shaped my expertise across AI and data science domains:

- At **Orange**, I worked on **evaluating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs)**, a project that culminated in a paper now under review. This experience taught me the intricacies of model adaptability and interpretability.

- At the **Grenoble Informatics Laboratory (LIG)**, I focused on **integrating information retrieval constraints into neural networks**, enhancing model efficiency.

- In another project at **LIG**, I applied **GAN-based data augmentation for semi-supervised learning**, refining my skills in robust model development.

- At the **Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences (GIN)**, I developed **imaging biomarkers for epilepsy** using clustering techniques, where I gained experience handling complex, multi-modal medical data.

I am proficient in Python, C/C++, Java, and various machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, making me well-equipped to tackle diverse challenges in AI and data science.

Outside of work, I stay current with tech trends, and in my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and spending time with family and friends. I am excited to bring my skills and dedication to a role that pushes the boundaries of AI and contributes to meaningful advancements.
