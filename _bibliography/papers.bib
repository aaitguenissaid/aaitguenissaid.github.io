  abstract = "Language models encode extensive factual knowledge within their parameters. The accurate assessment of this knowledge is crucial for understanding and improving these models. In the literature, factual knowledge assessment often relies on cloze sentences, which can lead to erroneous conclusions due to the complexity of natural language (out-of-subject continuations, the existence of many correct answers and the several ways of expressing them). In this paper, we introduce a new interpretable knowledge assessment method that mitigates these issues by leveraging distractors—incorrect but plausible alternatives to the correct answer. We propose several strategies for retrieving distractors and determine the most effective one through experimentation. Our method is evaluated against existing approaches, demonstrating solid alignment with human judgment and stronger robustness to verbalization artifacts. The code and data to reproduce our experiments are available on GitHub.",
